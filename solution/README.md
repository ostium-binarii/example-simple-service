# Solution: ostium-binarii (candidate Daniel Oh)

**Date:** 2020-06-22

## Summary
Lightweight reporting web service.
####CallOuts
Forgive the lack of a class diagram or call flow diagrams, this took me a little longer than I expected. Also note, that in the interest of time, certain key practices in some areas, such as thread-safety, defensive copying, and logging best practices were less focused on. Also note that the code is brittle to change in certain places, such as if we need to switch over to a database (I point this and the other callout throughout the code in comments). It would have been easier to make a more durable solution if spec, or some hints were given about what a future "production" version of the project would need to look like: (e.g. we intend to migrate over to a database, note that the data may grow to large amounts, note that new companies may be added, note that data may need to be hourly, this is a reporting service and will not need to POST data for example, etc. etc. etc.)

## Requirements and Usage
The project can be built using Apache Maven. After downloading the git repository, open the terminal do the following. Assumes at least the Java 8 JDK is set up and the user is on a Macintosh.
```bash
# navigate to the solution folder of the project.
cd {base_path}/take-home-exercise-ostium-binarii/solution
```
```bash
# unzip the provided apache-maven bin
unzip apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip
```
```bash
# temporarily set environment variables for the session to enable Maven commands.
JAVA_HOME={Java JDK Home on your machine, for me it looks like "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-12.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home"} 
PATH=$PATH:./apache-maven-3.6.3/bin
```
```bash
# check maven is working.
mvn -v
```
```bash
