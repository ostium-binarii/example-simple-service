# Interview Exercise

Welcome to the Capital Group technical interview take-home exercise. We recognize that your time is valuable so we greatly appreciate you making the investment. There are no _trick questions_ here, just a straight forward (and hopefully engaging) exercise that represents a typical programming problem solved at work.

## Context

Imagine you are tasked with delivering a RESTful API that will power a dashboard to assist an investment manager run a mutual fund comprised of the 5 so called [FAANG companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google) (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google). Assume the fund was begun on January 1st, 2013. This repo inludes a CSV [closing_prices.csv](closing_prices.csv) that contains the closing stock prices for the 5 companies for a number of years.

You will be asked to implement an API endpoint for each of 4 different questions about the data. The questions are purely hypothetical, but are designed to allow us to get a better feel for you as a software engineer.

## Expectations

We expect that this exercise will take a maximum of a few hours.

You will have a few days between receiving this exercise and the due date. Feel free to take your time, digest the problem and work at a pace and style that is suitable to you and your schedule.

We expect you to write code that you are proud of. This is not a race to see who can complete the exercise the fastest or in the fewest lines of code. Strive for your code to be of similar style and quality to your daily professional work. Imagine you are submitting a pull request to your team members to review and approve. While we normally strive for thorough test coverage, in the interest of time, please _pick one_ of the 4 questions and write a unit test that verifies the functionality.

In an on-site interview, we may ask you to extend your solution. Don't worry about trying to accomodate every conceivable unknown use-case, but do _think_ about how to be flexible by avoiding hard-coded limitations. For example, what happens if the sort order changes? etc. We strongly encourage you to use a programming language and libraries that you are familiar with.

## Ambiguity

If you are unsure about a question, or there are multiple technical approaches you considered, go ahead and make whatever assumptions you need to move forward. Just make note of your assumptions/choices either as code comments or within your solution README file.

## Steps

At a high level, this exercise will consist of the following steps:

1. Clone your personal fork of the exercise repository. If you're reading this, it should be available on GitHub at `https://github.com/capgroup-ig-tech-interviews/take-home-exercise-{your-github-name}`.
2. Read through this README and the [solution/README](solution/README.md) before coding.
3. All written code should be maintained with in the `solution` directory.
4. Work through and solve each question, creating a new `git` commit after each one is complete.
5. Fill out the [solution/README](solution/README.md) document to submit your work.

## Ready?

Once you're ready, head to the [FAANG Fund](solution/README.md) exercise document to get started!
